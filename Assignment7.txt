1.Python provides a re module that supports the use of regex in Python.
Its primary function is to offer a search, where it takes a regular expression and a string.
2.Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.
3.The find() method returns the index of first occurrence of the substring (if found).
If not found, it returns -1.
4.The group() method returns strings of the matched text
5.Group 0 is the entire match,
group 1 covers the first set of parentheses, 
and group 2 covers the second set of parentheses.
6.Periods and parentheses can be escaped with a backslash: \., \(, and \).
7.If the regex has no groups,
-a list of strings is returned. If the regex has groups, a list of tuples of strings is returned
8.The | character signifies matching "either, or" between two groups.
9.The ? character can either mean "match zero or one of the preceding group" 
or be used to signify nongreedy matching.
10.The + matches one or more. The * matches zero or more.
11.The {4} matches exactly three instances of the preceding group. The {4,5} matches between three and five instances.
12.The \d, \w, and \s shorthand character classes match a single digit, word, or space character, respectively.
13.The \D, \W, and \S shorthand character classes match a single character that is not a digit, word, or space character, respectively
14.Using 1.*1, * is greedy - it will match all the way to the end, and then backtrack until it can match 1, leaving you with 1010000000001.
.*? is non-greedy. * will match nothing, but then will try to match extra characters until it matches 1, eventually matching 101.

15.Its iteher [0-9a-z] or [a-z0-9]
16.Passing re.I or re.IGNORECASE as the second argument to re.compile() will make the matching case insensitive
17.The . character normally matches any character except the newline character. If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile(),
then the dot will also match newline characters.
18.'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'

19.The re.VERBOSE argument allows you to add whitespace and comments to the string passed to re.compile().

20.re.compile(r'^\d{1,3}(,\d{3})*$') will create this regex
 but other regex strings can produce a similar regular expression

21.re.compile(r'[A-Z][a-z]*\sWatanabe')

22.re.compile(r'(Alice|Bob|Carol)\s(eats|pets|throws)\s(apples|cats|baseballs)\.', re.IGNORECASE)
