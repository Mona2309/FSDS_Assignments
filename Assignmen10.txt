1. shutil.copy() will copy a single file while
shutil.copytree() will copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it.
Calling shutil.copytree(source, destination) will copy the folder at the path source, along with all of its files 
and subfolders,to the folder at the path destination. 
The source and destination parameters are both strings

2.os.rename() method in Python is used to rename a file or directory.
This method renames a source file/ directory to specified destination file/directory.

3.The send2trash functions will move a file or folder to the recycle bin, while shutil functions will permanently delete files and folders.

4.The zipfile.ZipFile() function is equivalent to the open() function; the first argument is the filename, 
and the second argument is the mode to open the ZIP file in (read, write, or append).

5.import os, shutil

def selectiveCopy(folder, extensions, destFolder):
	folder = os.path.abspath(folder)
	destFolder = os.path.abspath(destFolder)
	print('Looking in', folder, 'for files with extensions of', ', '.join(extensions))
	for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(folder):
		for filename in filenames:
			name, extension = os.path.splitext(filename)
			if extension in extensions:
				fileAbsPath = foldername + os.path.sep + filename
				print('Coping', fileAbsPath, 'to', destFolder)
				shutil.copy(fileAbsPath, destFolder)

extensions = ['.pdf', '.jpg']
folder = 'randomFolder'
destFolder = 'selectiveFolder'
selectiveCopy(folder, extensions, destFolder)
