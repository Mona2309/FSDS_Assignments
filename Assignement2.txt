1. Boolean data type is True and False
>>> a = True
>>> type(a)
<class 'bool'>

>>> b = False
>>> type(b)
<class 'bool'>


2. ANd , OR and Not are the three types of boolean oprators

3.x, y= 0,1
>>x
0
>>y
1
>>x*y
0
>>x*x
0
>>x+y
>>x,y=1,0
x*y
0
x+y
1

x  y  x or y
F  F   F
F  T   T
T  F   T
T  T   T

x  y  x and y
F  F  F
F  T  F
T  F  F
T  T  T

5.<, >, <=,>=,=,==

6.= It is used for assigning the value to a variable.
  == It is used for comparing two values. It returns 1 if both the values are equal otherwise returns 0.

a=5( variable a will hold the value=5)
b=6
if a==b
then print("equal")
else print("notequal")

so it will check if the value of b is 5 or not and will print acc

7. one -spam=0
if spam==10: print('eggs')
 
two- spam=0
if spam==10: print('eggs')
 
three- print('spam')
print('spam') 

8.spam =  int(input("Enter a number: "))
if (spam == 1):
    print('Hello')
elif (spam == 2):
     print('howdy')
else :
    print('Greetings!!')

9. ctrl+c
10.Break :It eliminates the execution of remaining iteration of loop
 Continue:It will terminate only the current iteration of loop.

11. When user call range() with one argument, user will get a series of numbers that starts at 0
for i in range(10):
    print(i, end=" ")
print()
o/p- 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

range(0, 10) range(start,stop)- When user call range() with two arguments, user get to decide not only where the series of numbers stops but also where it starts, 
so user don’t have to start at 0 all the time. 
for i in range(0,10):
    print(i, end=" ")
print()
o/p- 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

using range for iteration
range(0, 10, 1)(range(start,stop, step) When the user call range() with three arguments, the user can choose not only where the series of numbers will start and stop but also
how big the difference will be between one number and the next. If the user doesn’t provide a step, then range() will automatically behave as if the step is 1. 

for i in range(0,10,2):
    print(i, end=" ")
print()

0/p 0 2 4 6 8 

12. for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

i = 1
while i <= 10:
	print(i)
	i += 1
